# Royalitics

A smart way to see insights on royalties gained and lost for your NFT collection is to use a specialized tracking tool or platform. This tool can help you keep track of the royalties earned from your NFTs, as well as any royalties lost due to NFTs that have been resold or otherwise transferred. The tool can also provide detailed information and analysis on the performance of your NFT collection, including data on the sales and transfers of individual NFTs, the total value of your collection, and the average royalties earned per NFT. By using a specialized tracking tool, you can gain valuable insights into the performance of your NFT collection and make informed decisions about how to manage and grow your collection.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Build and Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Structure

The scaffold project structure may vary based on the front end framework being utilized. The below is an example structure for the Next js Scaffold.

```
├── public : publically hosted files
├── src : primary code folders and files
│   ├── components : should house anything considered a resuable UI component
│   ├── contexts` : any context considered reusable and useuful to many compoennts that can be passed down through a component tree
│   ├── hooks` : any functions that let you 'hook' into react state or lifecycle features from function components
│   ├── models` : any data structure that may be reused throughout the project
│   ├── pages` : the pages that host meta data and the intended `View` for the page
│   ├── stores` : stores used in state management
│   ├── styles` : contain any global and reusable styles
│   ├── utils` : any other functionality considered reusable code that can be referenced
│   ├── views` : contains the actual views of the project that include the main content and components within
style, package, configuration, and other project files

```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
